# YSA Activity App

**Problem statement:** As a member of a YSA Ward who is looking for a spouse, I want to easily know what activities are going on in the ward, so that I can make informed decisions on where I should allocate my time to achieve my goal of finding a spouse and establishing deeper connections with my peers.

**Product vision statement:** 
To be the most YSA-centric app where ward event information is as available and easy to understand as possible so more can attend events that deepen their testimony of Christ and their relationship with their peers.
